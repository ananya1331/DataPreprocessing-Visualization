# Exercise 02 – Data Integration, Cleaning, and Normalization (Netflix Dataset)

**Question:**  
Using the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset (`netflix_titles.csv`), perform the following tasks:

1. **Load the dataset** and display:
   - Shape of the dataset
   - Column names and their data types
   - First 10 records

2. **Generate a summary report** using `describe()` for numerical columns.

3. **Identify and count missing values** per column.

4. **Handle missing values** using three different methods:
   - Impute with mean/median/mode
   - Forward-fill / backward-fill
   - Drop rows or columns with missing values  
   Compare the results of each method.

5. **Detect duplicate rows**, remove them, and report how many were deleted.

6. **Identify inconsistent values** in categorical columns (e.g., “India” vs. “IND”) and standardize them.

7. **Clean text columns** using string operations:
   - Remove extra spaces
   - Convert all text to lowercase (or uppercase)

8. **Detect outliers** in one numerical column (e.g., `release_year`) using the IQR method and remove them.

9. **Save the cleaned dataset** as `netflix_cleaned.csv`.

10. **Data Integration**  
    - Choose a second dataset from Kaggle that shares a common column (e.g., country, title, or year).  
    - Perform the following merges with the Netflix dataset:
      - Inner Join
      - Left Join
      - Right Join
      - Outer Join  
      Compare the number of rows after each join.
    - Rename mismatched column names where necessary.
    - Handle conflicting values after merging (e.g., country spellings).
    - Add a new column from the second dataset into Netflix (e.g., GDP per country).
    - Concatenate the two datasets row-wise and column-wise, then compare results.
    - Save the integrated dataset as `netflix_integrated.csv`.

11. **Normalization and Standardization**  
    - Choose at least two numerical columns (e.g., `release_year`, `duration`).  
    - Compute summary statistics (mean, median, std, min, max).  
    - Apply the following scaling techniques and verify:
      - Min-Max Normalization (range [0,1])
      - Z-score Standardization (mean ≈ 0, std ≈ 1)
      - Decimal scaling normalization  
    - Compare original, Min-Max, and Z-score values in a small table.
    - Plot histograms of one feature:
      - Before standardization
      - After Min-Max scaling
      - After Z-score scaling  
    - Save the standardized dataset as `netflix_standardized.csv`.

**Answer Files:**  
- `netflix.py` → Python implementation  
- `netflix_cleaned.csv` → cleaned dataset  
- `netflix_integrated.csv` → integrated dataset  
- `netflix_standardized.csv` → standardized dataset  
- `results/` → plots and additional outputs
